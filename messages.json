The decision was prompted by the bishop’s public statements during a Sunday sermon, where he claimed that a member of the current government was involved in planning his assassination.\n\nThe investigation has been initiated under Article 18-108 of the Georgian Criminal Code, which pertains to the preparation of premeditated murder.\n\n“The Prosecutor’s Office has started the investigation. All necessary investigative and procedural actions will be carried out,” the office announced.\n\nBishop Giorgi stated that “a government member” had been planning to poison him. He claimed that a nun who served in his diocese had been coerced by security services for over a year to administer poison in his food or directly onto his skin.\n\n> “It is very sad that people I shared meals with, whom I considered brothers and friends, were preparing to kill me,” said the bishop. “They recruited a nun from my diocese and tried to force her to put poison in my food or on my hand. These are the kinds of events and situations we face in the diocese.”\n\nHe alleged that the individual behind the plot had fled with security guards. Bishop Giorgi emphasized that he had not physically harmed the alleged conspirator because of his duty as a clergyman. He warned that he expects provocations and believes that the plot was supported by powerful forces.\n\n> “Today, this person has been summoned and charged. I have pronounced him a traitor, like Judas, who was preparing to kill me,” the bishop declared, further adding, “He is a current government member. If the government does not distance itself from him, much will become clearer to me.”\n\nBishop Giorgi has been known for his homophobic and anti-Western statements, his criticism of the United National Movement party, and his negative views on civil society organizations.\n\nIn February 2024, Georgian media reported that the bishop had broken his vow of celibacy and married. In December 2024, he described the brutal violence against demonstrators in Tbilisi’s Rustaveli Avenue as a “common pain and tragedy of the nation.” In 2020, he accused the ruling Georgian Dream party of conducting a smear campaign against him to remove him from his diocese. Most recently, on May 28, 2025, he supported imprisoned media manager and journalist Mzia Amaglobeli, saying that the punishment she is serving is excessively harsh."

He did not name the official. The Prosecutor’s Office has launched an investigation.\n\nJamdeliani said the person behind the alleged plot is a “senior official,” specifically a “representative of the security agency.” He described the individual as an “incumbent member of the government,” adding, “If the government does not distance itself from him, then more will become clear to me.”\n\nThe bishop said that a nun from his diocese had been enlisted to carry out the plot. He claimed she had been instructed for a year to poison his meal or apply a toxin to his hand that would kill him “within an hour.” He said the person behind the plot was “beaten and kicked out [of here] with his guards.”\n\n“Now, we can expect anything from him, any provocation, ” Jamdeliani said. “I think some forces are behind him.”\n\nFollowing Jamdeliani’s claims, which quickly went viral, the Georgian Prosecutor’s Office launched a criminal investigation under Articles 18 and 108 of the Criminal Code, involving preparation of a crime and intentional murder.\n\nSpeaking to TV Pirveli about the investigation, the bishop confirmed that prosecutors had contacted him, but he refused to cooperate. “They reached out to me, but I am exercising my constitutional rights as a member of the clergy,” he said, adding that he intends to act in line with church canon law. “At this stage, I am neither giving testimony nor intending to cooperate with the Prosecutor’s Office or the police.”\n\n**Also Read:**\n\n*   **15/02/2024 – Deacon Giorgi Mamaladze Convicted in ‘Cyanide Case’ Released**\n*   **08/03/2021 – Tensions Boil Over as P a rish Refuses New Bishop in Martvili**\n*   **01/11/2019 – Dismissed by Synod, Chkondidi Bishop says Patriarch ‘Possessed by Homosexuality’**\n\nThis post is also available in: ქართული\n\nRead Next\n---------\n\n20/05/2025 - 14:55\n\n### Georgia Hands Over Suspects in Transnational Trafficking Case to French Authorities\n\n02/04/2025 - 08:59\n\n### The Daily Beat: 1 April\n\n03/12/2024 - 22:26\n\n### Prosecutor Charges Three for Assaulting Policemen, Damaging Property\n\n27/11/2024 - 13:54\n\n### Watchdog Urges Investigation Into Alleged Police Violence Against Protester\n\n31/10/2024 - 16:41\n\n### The Daily Beat: 30 October\n\n30/10/2024 - 12:49\n\n### Prosecutor Launches Investigation into Election Fraud Allegations, Summons President for Questioning"
