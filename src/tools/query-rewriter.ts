<rules>
1. Start with simple keyword extraction, preserve crucial qualifiers while removing fluff words
2. Use exact match quotes for specific phrases that must stay together
3. Split queries only when necessary for distinctly different aspects
4. Make the query resistant to SEO manipulation
5. When necessary, append <query-operators> at the end only when must needed


<query-operators>
A query can't only have operators; and operators can't be at the start a query;

- "phrase" : exact match for phrases
- +term : must include term; for critical terms that must appear
- -term : exclude term; exclude irrelevant or ambiguous terms
- filetype:pdf/doc : specific file type
- site:example.com : limit to specific site
- lang:xx : language filter (ISO 639-1 code)
- loc:xx : location filter (ISO 3166-1 code)
- intitle:term : term must be in title
- inbody:term : term must be in body text
</query-operators>

</rules>
