    system: `You are an evaluator of answer definitiveness. Analyze if the given answer provides a definitive response or not.

<rules>
First, if the answer is not a direct response to the question, it must return false.

Definitiveness means providing a clear, confident response. The following approaches are considered definitive:
  1. Direct, clear statements that address the question
  2. Comprehensive answers that cover multiple perspectives or both sides of an issue
  3. Answers that acknowledge complexity while still providing substantive information
  4. Balanced explanations that present pros and cons or different viewpoints

The following types of responses are NOT definitive and must return false:
  1. Expressions of personal uncertainty: "I don't know", "not sure", "might be", "probably"
  2. Lack of information statements: "doesn't exist", "lack of information", "could not find"
  3. Inability statements: "I cannot provide", "I am unable to", "we cannot"
  4. Negative statements that redirect: "However, you can...", "Instead, try..."
  5. Non-answers that suggest alternatives without addressing the original question
  
Note: A definitive answer can acknowledge legitimate complexity or present multiple viewpoints as long as it does so with confidence and provides substantive information directly addressing the question.

<examples>
Question: "What are the system requirements for running Python 3.9?"
Answer: "I'm not entirely sure, but I think you need a computer with some RAM."
Evaluation: {
  "think": "The answer contains uncertainty markers like 'not entirely sure' and 'I think', making it non-definitive."
  "pass": false,

Question: "Should companies use AI for hiring decisions?"
Answer: "There are compelling arguments on both sides of this issue. Companies using AI in hiring can benefit from reduced bias in initial screening, faster processing of large applicant pools, and potentially better matches based on skills assessment. However, these systems can also perpetuate historical biases in training data, may miss nuanced human qualities, and raise privacy concerns. The effectiveness depends on careful implementation, human oversight, and regular auditing of these systems."

### Implementation Notes:
1. **Contextual Adjustment**: Freshness requirements may change during crises or rapid developments in specific domains.
2. **Tiered Approach**: Consider implementing urgency levels (critical, important, standard) alongside age thresholds.
3. **User Preferences**: Allow customization of thresholds for specific query types or user needs.
4. **Source Reliability**: Pair freshness metrics with source credibility scores for better quality assessment.
5. **Domain Specificity**: Some specialized fields (medical research during pandemics, financial data during market volatility) may require dynamically adjusted thresholds.
6. **Geographic Relevance**: Regional considerations may alter freshness requirements for local regulations or events.

  return {
    system: `You are an evaluator that determines if an answer addresses all explicitly mentioned aspects of a multi-aspect question.

<rules>
For questions with **explicitly** multiple aspects:

1. Explicit Aspect Identification:
   - Only identify aspects that are explicitly mentioned in the question
   - Look for specific topics, dimensions, or categories mentioned by name
   - Aspects may be separated by commas, "and", "or", bullets, or mentioned in phrases like "such as X, Y, and Z"
   - DO NOT include implicit aspects that might be relevant but aren't specifically mentioned

2. Coverage Assessment:
   - Each explicitly mentioned aspect should be addressed in the answer
   - Recognize that answers may use different terminology, synonyms, or paraphrases for the same aspects
   - Look for conceptual coverage rather than exact wording matches
   - Calculate a coverage score (aspects addressed / aspects explicitly mentioned)

3. Pass/Fail Determination:
   - Pass: Addresses all explicitly mentioned aspects, even if using different terminology or written in different language styles
   - Fail: Misses one or more explicitly mentioned aspects
</rules>

<examples>
Question: "How does climate change impact agricultural practices, water resources, and biodiversity in Mediterranean regions?"
Answer: "Climate change affects Mediterranean agriculture through rising temperatures and changing rainfall patterns. Farmers now implement drip irrigation to conserve water and shift planting schedules. Freshwater availability has decreased dramatically, with groundwater depletion and seasonal streams drying up earlier each year."
Aspects_Expected: "agricultural practices, water resources, biodiversity"
Aspects_Provided: "farming adaptations, irrigation methods, precipitation changes, freshwater availability, groundwater depletion"
Think: "The question explicitly mentions three aspects: agricultural practices, water resources, and biodiversity. The answer addresses agricultural practices (discussing farming adaptations, irrigation methods, planting schedules) and water resources (covering freshwater availability, groundwater depletion, seasonal streams). However, it completely omits any discussion of biodiversity effects, which was explicitly requested in the question."
Pass: false

Question: "What are the key considerations when designing a microservice architecture, including scalability, fault tolerance, and data consistency patterns?"
Answer: "When engineering distributed systems, horizontal expansion capacity is crucial - teams should implement load distribution and auto-scaling for peak demand periods. System resilience is achieved through failure detection mechanisms, redundancy implementations, and isolation boundaries to prevent cascading outages. For maintaining data integrity across services, developers can implement orchestrated transaction sequences, append-only event logs, and separate command/query responsibility models."
Aspects_Expected: "scalability, fault tolerance, data consistency patterns"
Aspects_Provided: "horizontal expansion capacity, load distribution, auto-scaling, system resilience, failure detection, redundancy, isolation boundaries, data integrity, orchestrated transaction sequences, append-only event logs, command/query responsibility models"
Think: "The question explicitly mentions three aspects of microservice architecture: scalability, fault tolerance, and data consistency patterns. Although using different terminology, the answer addresses all three: scalability (through 'horizontal expansion capacity', 'load distribution', and 'auto-scaling'), fault tolerance (via 'system resilience', 'failure detection', 'redundancy', and 'isolation boundaries'), and data consistency patterns (discussing 'data integrity', 'orchestrated transaction sequences', 'append-only event logs', and 'command/query responsibility models'). All explicitly mentioned aspects are covered despite the terminology differences."
Pass: true

Question: "Compare iOS and Android in terms of user interface, app ecosystem, and security."
Answer: "Apple's mobile platform presents users with a curated visual experience emphasizing minimalist design and consistency, while Google's offering focuses on flexibility and customization options. The App Store's review process creates a walled garden with higher quality control but fewer options, whereas Play Store offers greater developer freedom and variety. Apple employs strict sandboxing techniques and maintains tight hardware-software integration."
Aspects_Expected: "user interface, app ecosystem, security"
Aspects_Provided: "visual experience, minimalist design, flexibility, customization, App Store review process, walled garden, quality control, Play Store, developer freedom, sandboxing, hardware-software integration"
Think: "The question explicitly asks for a comparison of iOS and Android across three specific aspects: user interface, app ecosystem, and security. The answer addresses user interface (discussing 'visual experience', 'minimalist design', 'flexibility', and 'customization') and app ecosystem (mentioning 'App Store review process', 'walled garden', 'quality control', 'Play Store', and 'developer freedom'). For security, it mentions 'sandboxing' and 'hardware-software integration', which are security features of iOS, but doesn't provide a comparative analysis of Android's security approach. Since security is only partially addressed for one platform, the comparison of this aspect is incomplete."
Pass: false

Question: "Explain how social media affects teenagers' mental health, academic performance, and social relationships."
Answer: "Platforms like Instagram and TikTok have been linked to psychological distress among adolescents, with documented increases in comparative thinking patterns and anxiety about social exclusion. Scholastic achievement often suffers as screen time increases, with homework completion rates declining and attention spans fragmenting during study sessions. Peer connections show a complex duality - digital platforms facilitate constant contact with friend networks while sometimes diminishing in-person social skill development and enabling new forms of peer harassment."
Aspects_Expected: "mental health, academic performance, social relationships"
Aspects_Provided: "psychological distress, comparative thinking, anxiety about social exclusion, scholastic achievement, screen time, homework completion, attention spans, peer connections, constant contact with friend networks, in-person social skill development, peer harassment"
Think: "The question explicitly asks about three aspects of social media's effects on teenagers: mental health, academic performance, and social relationships. The answer addresses all three using different terminology: mental health (discussing 'psychological distress', 'comparative thinking', 'anxiety about social exclusion'), academic performance (mentioning 'scholastic achievement', 'screen time', 'homework completion', 'attention spans'), and social relationships (covering 'peer connections', 'constant contact with friend networks', 'in-person social skill development', and 'peer harassment'). All explicitly mentioned aspects are covered despite using different language."
Pass: true

Question: "What economic and political factors contributed to the 2008 financial crisis?"
Answer: "The real estate market collapse after years of high-risk lending practices devastated mortgage-backed securities' value. Wall Street had created intricate derivative products that disguised underlying risk levels, while credit assessment organizations failed in their oversight role. Legislative changes in the financial industry during the 1990s eliminated regulatory guardrails that previously limited excessive leverage and speculation among investment banks."
Aspects_Expected: "economic factors, political factors"
Aspects_Provided: "real estate market collapse, high-risk lending, mortgage-backed securities, derivative products, risk disguising, credit assessment failures, legislative changes, regulatory guardrail elimination, leverage, speculation"
Think: "The question explicitly asks about two categories of factors: economic and political. The answer addresses economic factors ('real estate market collapse', 'high-risk lending', 'mortgage-backed securities', 'derivative products', 'risk disguising', 'credit assessment failures') and political factors ('legislative changes', 'regulatory guardrail elimination'). While using different terminology, the answer covers both explicitly requested aspects."

Think: "问题明确要求解释人工智能在三个领域的应用：医疗诊断、自动驾驶和客户服务。回答虽然使用了不同的术语，但涵盖了所有三个方面：医疗诊断（讨论了'医学影像分析'和'癌症检测'），自动驾驶（包括'雷达数据处理'、'激光雷达数据处理'、'摄像头数据处理'和'实时驾驶决策'），以及客户服务（提到了'聊天机器人'、'智能助手'和'客户查询分类'）。尽管使用了不同的表述，但所有明确提及的方面都得到了全面覆盖。"
Pass: true

Question: "Comment les changements climatiques affectent-ils la production agricole, les écosystèmes marins et la santé publique dans les régions côtières?"
Answer: "Les variations de température et de précipitations modifient les cycles de croissance des cultures et la distribution des ravageurs agricoles, nécessitant des adaptations dans les pratiques de culture. Dans les océans, l'acidification et le réchauffement des eaux entraînent le blanchissement des coraux et la migration des espèces marines vers des latitudes plus froides, perturbant les chaînes alimentaires existantes."

freshness - Checks if the question is time-sensitive or requires very recent information
plurality - Checks if the question asks for multiple items, examples, or a specific count or enumeration
completeness - Checks if the question explicitly mentions multiple named elements that all need to be addressed
</evaluation_types>

<rules>
1. Definitive Evaluation:
   - Required for ALMOST ALL questions - assume by default that definitive evaluation is needed
   - Not required ONLY for questions that are genuinely impossible to evaluate definitively
   - Examples of impossible questions: paradoxes, questions beyond all possible knowledge
   - Even subjective-seeming questions can be evaluated definitively based on evidence
   - Future scenarios can be evaluated definitively based on current trends and information
   - Look for cases where the question is inherently unanswerable by any possible means

2. Freshness Evaluation:
   - Required for questions about current state, recent events, or time-sensitive information
   - Required for: prices, versions, leadership positions, status updates
   - Look for terms: "current", "latest", "recent", "now", "today", "new"
   - Consider company positions, product versions, market data time-sensitive

3. Plurality Evaluation:
   - ONLY apply when completeness check is NOT triggered
   - Required when question asks for multiple examples, items, or specific counts
   - Check for: numbers ("5 examples"), list requests ("list the ways"), enumeration requests
   - Look for: "examples", "list", "enumerate", "ways to", "methods for", "several"
   - Focus on requests for QUANTITY of items or examples

4. Completeness Evaluation:
   - Takes precedence over plurality check - if completeness applies, set plurality to false
   - Required when question EXPLICITLY mentions multiple named elements that all need to be addressed
   - This includes:
     * Named aspects or dimensions: "economic, social, and environmental factors"
     * Named entities: "Apple, Microsoft, and Google", "Biden and Trump"
     * Named products: "iPhone 15 and Samsung Galaxy S24"
     * Named locations: "New York, Paris, and Tokyo"
     * Named time periods: "Renaissance and Industrial Revolution"
   - Look for explicitly named elements separated by commas, "and", "or", bullets
   - Example patterns: "comparing X and Y", "differences between A, B, and C", "both P and Q"
   - DO NOT trigger for elements that aren't specifically named

谁发明了微积分？牛顿和莱布尼兹各自的贡献是什么？
<think>
这是关于微积分历史的问题，不涉及需要最新信息的内容。问题明确提到了牛顿和莱布尼兹两位数学家，要求分析他们各自的贡献，所以需要全面评估这两个特定的方面。这个问题涉及历史事实，有明确的学术研究可以参考，因此需要确定性评估。

fam PLEASE help me calculate the eigenvalues of this 4x4 matrix ASAP!! [matrix details] got an exam tmrw 😭
<think>
This is a mathematical question about eigenvalues which doesn't change over time, so no need for recent information. A 4x4 matrix has multiple eigenvalues, so this requires identifying several distinct values. This is a pure mathematics problem with precise, verifiable solutions that can be definitively evaluated. The question asks for calculation of eigenvalues only, not addressing multiple distinct topics.

Quelles sont les principales différences entre le romantisme et le réalisme dans la littérature du 19ème siècle?
<think>
C'est une question sur l'histoire littéraire, donc aucun besoin d'informations récentes. La question mentionne spécifiquement deux mouvements: le romantisme et le réalisme. Je dois évaluer ces deux éléments nommés, donc l'exhaustivité est importante ici. Cette question porte sur des concepts littéraires établis avec des caractéristiques documentées, donc une évaluation définitive est possible. La question ne demande pas une liste ou énumération multiple au-delà des deux mouvements spécifiés.

Shakespeare の最も有名な悲劇を5つ挙げ、簡単にあらすじを説明してください。

シェイクスピアの悲劇についての質問であり、時事的な情報は不要。「5つ挙げ」という指定があるため、複数の項目が求められている。「最も有名な」という基準は学術的コンセンサスや文化的重要性に基づいて判断できるため、確定的な評価が可能。特定の作品を分析するよう求められているわけではなく、複数の作品を列挙することが主な要件。

What are the current interest rates for mortgage loans from Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and Chase Bank in the US?
<think>
This question asks about "current" interest rates, so it clearly requires up-to-date information. The query specifically names three banks: Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and Chase Bank. Each of these named entities must be addressed, making completeness necessary. This question seeks factual financial data that can be objectively verified, so definitive evaluation is needed. The question isn't asking for multiple types of information beyond the specified banks.

Was sind die besten Strategien für nachhaltiges Investieren in der heutigen Wirtschaft?
<think>
Diese Frage bezieht sich auf die "heutige Wirtschaft", daher sind aktuelle Informationen erforderlich. "Strategien" steht im Plural, was auf die Notwendigkeit mehrerer Beispiele hindeutet. Obwohl "beste" subjektiv klingen mag, lässt sich die Frage anhand von Rendite-Daten, Risikobewertungen und Nachhaltigkeitskriterien definitiv evaluieren. Es werden keine spezifischen Aspekte genannt, die alle behandelt werden müssen - der Fokus liegt auf der Vielfalt der Strategien.

How might artificial intelligence transform the healthcare industry over the next decade?
<think>
This question asks about future developments that require recent AI and healthcare information to properly evaluate. The query is about transformations (plural) suggesting multiple changes should be identified. While it concerns future trends, the patterns can be evaluated definitively based on current research, development pipelines, and industry analyses. No specific aspects of healthcare are mentioned that must all be addressed, so plurality is more relevant than completeness.

What do you think is the best approach to learning a new language as an adult?
<think>
This question about language learning does not require time-sensitive information as fundamental language acquisition principles remain relatively stable. The phrasing suggests looking for multiple elements or methods that constitute an effective approach, indicating plurality. Though the question uses subjective language ("what do you think"), it can be evaluated definitively using linguistic research and proven methodologies. No specific language learning aspects are explicitly named that must all be covered.

If a tree falls in a forest with absolutely no observers, instruments, or any possible way to detect it, does it make a sound?
<think>
This is a classic philosophical paradox that is inherently unanswerable in a definitive way. The question deliberately constructs a scenario that removes all possible means of verification, making it logically impossible to evaluate. This kind of question represents one of the rare cases where a definitive evaluation is truly impossible. The question doesn't involve recent events, doesn't request multiple items, and doesn't specify multiple elements that must be addressed.
