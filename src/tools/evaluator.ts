### Implementation Notes:
1. **Contextual Adjustment**: Freshness requirements may change during crises or rapid developments in specific domains.
2. **Tiered Approach**: Consider implementing urgency levels (critical, important, standard) alongside age thresholds.
3. **User Preferences**: Allow customization of thresholds for specific query types or user needs.
4. **Source Reliability**: Pair freshness metrics with source credibility scores for better quality assessment.
5. **Domain Specificity**: Some specialized fields (medical research during pandemics, financial data during market volatility) may require dynamically adjusted thresholds.
6. **Geographic Relevance**: Regional considerations may alter freshness requirements for local regulations or events.

  return {
    system: `You are an evaluator that determines if an answer addresses all explicitly mentioned aspects of a multi-aspect question.

<rules>
For questions with **explicitly** multiple aspects:

1. Explicit Aspect Identification:
   - Only identify aspects that are explicitly mentioned in the question
   - Look for specific topics, dimensions, or categories mentioned by name
   - Aspects may be separated by commas, "and", "or", bullets, or mentioned in phrases like "such as X, Y, and Z"
   - DO NOT include implicit aspects that might be relevant but aren't specifically mentioned

2. Coverage Assessment:
   - Each explicitly mentioned aspect should be addressed in the answer
   - Recognize that answers may use different terminology, synonyms, or paraphrases for the same aspects
   - Look for conceptual coverage rather than exact wording matches
   - Calculate a coverage score (aspects addressed / aspects explicitly mentioned)

3. Pass/Fail Determination:
   - Pass: Addresses all explicitly mentioned aspects, even if using different terminology or written in different language styles
   - Fail: Misses one or more explicitly mentioned aspects
</rules>

<examples>
Question: "How does climate change impact agricultural practices, water resources, and biodiversity in Mediterranean regions?"
Answer: "Climate change affects Mediterranean agriculture through rising temperatures and changing rainfall patterns. Farmers now implement drip irrigation to conserve water and shift planting schedules. Freshwater availability has decreased dramatically, with groundwater depletion and seasonal streams drying up earlier each year."
Aspects_Expected: "agricultural practices, water resources, biodiversity"
Aspects_Provided: "farming adaptations, irrigation methods, precipitation changes, freshwater availability, groundwater depletion"
Think: "The question explicitly mentions three aspects: agricultural practices, water resources, and biodiversity. The answer addresses agricultural practices (discussing farming adaptations, irrigation methods, planting schedules) and water resources (covering freshwater availability, groundwater depletion, seasonal streams). However, it completely omits any discussion of biodiversity effects, which was explicitly requested in the question."
Pass: false

Question: "What are the key considerations when designing a microservice architecture, including scalability, fault tolerance, and data consistency patterns?"
Answer: "When engineering distributed systems, horizontal expansion capacity is crucial - teams should implement load distribution and auto-scaling for peak demand periods. System resilience is achieved through failure detection mechanisms, redundancy implementations, and isolation boundaries to prevent cascading outages. For maintaining data integrity across services, developers can implement orchestrated transaction sequences, append-only event logs, and separate command/query responsibility models."
Aspects_Expected: "scalability, fault tolerance, data consistency patterns"
Aspects_Provided: "horizontal expansion capacity, load distribution, auto-scaling, system resilience, failure detection, redundancy, isolation boundaries, data integrity, orchestrated transaction sequences, append-only event logs, command/query responsibility models"
Think: "The question explicitly mentions three aspects of microservice architecture: scalability, fault tolerance, and data consistency patterns. Although using different terminology, the answer addresses all three: scalability (through 'horizontal expansion capacity', 'load distribution', and 'auto-scaling'), fault tolerance (via 'system resilience', 'failure detection', 'redundancy', and 'isolation boundaries'), and data consistency patterns (discussing 'data integrity', 'orchestrated transaction sequences', 'append-only event logs', and 'command/query responsibility models'). All explicitly mentioned aspects are covered despite the terminology differences."
Pass: true

Question: "Compare iOS and Android in terms of user interface, app ecosystem, and security."
Answer: "Apple's mobile platform presents users with a curated visual experience emphasizing minimalist design and consistency, while Google's offering focuses on flexibility and customization options. The App Store's review process creates a walled garden with higher quality control but fewer options, whereas Play Store offers greater developer freedom and variety. Apple employs strict sandboxing techniques and maintains tight hardware-software integration."
Aspects_Expected: "user interface, app ecosystem, security"
Aspects_Provided: "visual experience, minimalist design, flexibility, customization, App Store review process, walled garden, quality control, Play Store, developer freedom, sandboxing, hardware-software integration"
Think: "The question explicitly asks for a comparison of iOS and Android across three specific aspects: user interface, app ecosystem, and security. The answer addresses user interface (discussing 'visual experience', 'minimalist design', 'flexibility', and 'customization') and app ecosystem (mentioning 'App Store review process', 'walled garden', 'quality control', 'Play Store', and 'developer freedom'). For security, it mentions 'sandboxing' and 'hardware-software integration', which are security features of iOS, but doesn't provide a comparative analysis of Android's security approach. Since security is only partially addressed for one platform, the comparison of this aspect is incomplete."
Pass: false

Question: "Explain how social media affects teenagers' mental health, academic performance, and social relationships."
Answer: "Platforms like Instagram and TikTok have been linked to psychological distress among adolescents, with documented increases in comparative thinking patterns and anxiety about social exclusion. Scholastic achievement often suffers as screen time increases, with homework completion rates declining and attention spans fragmenting during study sessions. Peer connections show a complex duality - digital platforms facilitate constant contact with friend networks while sometimes diminishing in-person social skill development and enabling new forms of peer harassment."
Aspects_Expected: "mental health, academic performance, social relationships"
Aspects_Provided: "psychological distress, comparative thinking, anxiety about social exclusion, scholastic achievement, screen time, homework completion, attention spans, peer connections, constant contact with friend networks, in-person social skill development, peer harassment"
Think: "The question explicitly asks about three aspects of social media's effects on teenagers: mental health, academic performance, and social relationships. The answer addresses all three using different terminology: mental health (discussing 'psychological distress', 'comparative thinking', 'anxiety about social exclusion'), academic performance (mentioning 'scholastic achievement', 'screen time', 'homework completion', 'attention spans'), and social relationships (covering 'peer connections', 'constant contact with friend networks', 'in-person social skill development', and 'peer harassment'). All explicitly mentioned aspects are covered despite using different language."
Pass: true

Question: "What economic and political factors contributed to the 2008 financial crisis?"
Answer: "The real estate market collapse after years of high-risk lending practices devastated mortgage-backed securities' value. Wall Street had created intricate derivative products that disguised underlying risk levels, while credit assessment organizations failed in their oversight role. Legislative changes in the financial industry during the 1990s eliminated regulatory guardrails that previously limited excessive leverage and speculation among investment banks."
Aspects_Expected: "economic factors, political factors"
Aspects_Provided: "real estate market collapse, high-risk lending, mortgage-backed securities, derivative products, risk disguising, credit assessment failures, legislative changes, regulatory guardrail elimination, leverage, speculation"
Think: "The question explicitly asks about two categories of factors: economic and political. The answer addresses economic factors ('real estate market collapse', 'high-risk lending', 'mortgage-backed securities', 'derivative products', 'risk disguising', 'credit assessment failures') and political factors ('legislative changes', 'regulatory guardrail elimination'). While using different terminology, the answer covers both explicitly requested aspects."

Question: "请解释人工智能在医疗诊断、自动驾驶和客户服务方面的应用。"
Answer: "在医疗领域，AI算法可以分析医学影像以检测癌症和其他疾病，准确率有时甚至超过人类专家。自动驾驶技术利用机器学习处理来自雷达、激光雷达和摄像头的数据，实时做出驾驶决策。在客户服务方面，聊天机器人和智能助手能够处理常见问题，分类客户查询，并在必要时将复杂问题转给人工代表。"

Think: "问题明确要求解释人工智能在三个领域的应用：医疗诊断、自动驾驶和客户服务。回答虽然使用了不同的术语，但涵盖了所有三个方面：医疗诊断（讨论了'医学影像分析'和'癌症检测'），自动驾驶（包括'雷达数据处理'、'激光雷达数据处理'、'摄像头数据处理'和'实时驾驶决策'），以及客户服务（提到了'聊天机器人'、'智能助手'和'客户查询分类'）。尽管使用了不同的表述，但所有明确提及的方面都得到了全面覆盖。"
Pass: true

Question: "Comment les changements climatiques affectent-ils la production agricole, les écosystèmes marins et la santé publique dans les régions côtières?"
Answer: "Les variations de température et de précipitations modifient les cycles de croissance des cultures et la distribution des ravageurs agricoles, nécessitant des adaptations dans les pratiques de culture. Dans les océans, l'acidification et le réchauffement des eaux entraînent le blanchissement des coraux et la migration des espèces marines vers des latitudes plus froides, perturbant les chaînes alimentaires existantes."

    system: `You are an evaluator that determines if a question requires freshness, plurality, and/or completeness checks.

<evaluation_types>
1. freshness - Checks if the question is time-sensitive or requires very recent information
2. plurality - Checks if the question asks for multiple items, examples, or a specific count or enumeration
3. completeness - Checks if the question explicitly mentions multiple named elements that all need to be addressed
</evaluation_types>

<rules>
1. Freshness Evaluation:
   - Required for questions about current state, recent events, or time-sensitive information
   - Required for: prices, versions, leadership positions, status updates
   - Look for terms: "current", "latest", "recent", "now", "today", "new"
   - Consider company positions, product versions, market data time-sensitive

2. Plurality Evaluation:
   - ONLY apply when completeness check is NOT triggered
   - Required when question asks for multiple examples, items, or specific counts
   - Check for: numbers ("5 examples"), list requests ("list the ways"), enumeration requests
   - Look for: "examples", "list", "enumerate", "ways to", "methods for", "several"
   - Focus on requests for QUANTITY of items or examples

3. Completeness Evaluation:
   - Takes precedence over plurality check - if completeness applies, set plurality to false
   - Required when question EXPLICITLY mentions multiple named elements that all need to be addressed
   - This includes:
     * Named aspects or dimensions: "economic, social, and environmental factors"
     * Named entities: "Apple, Microsoft, and Google", "Biden and Trump"
     * Named products: "iPhone 15 and Samsung Galaxy S24"
     * Named locations: "New York, Paris, and Tokyo"
     * Named time periods: "Renaissance and Industrial Revolution"
   - Look for explicitly named elements separated by commas, "and", "or", bullets
   - Example patterns: "comparing X and Y", "differences between A, B, and C", "both P and Q"
   - DO NOT trigger for elements that aren't specifically named

谁发明了微积分？牛顿和莱布尼兹各自的贡献是什么？

这是关于微积分历史的问题，不需要最新信息。问题特别提到了牛顿和莱布尼兹两个人，要求分析他们各自的贡献，所以我需要全面回答这两部分内容。完整性比较重要，而不是提供多个不同答案。

fam PLEASE help me calculate the eigenvalues of this 4x4 matrix ASAP!! [matrix details] got an exam tmrw 😭
<think>
This is a math question about eigenvalues which doesn't change over time, so I don't need fresh info. A 4x4 matrix has multiple eigenvalues, so I'll need to provide several results. The student just wants the eigenvalues calculated, not asking me to address multiple specific topics.

Quelles sont les principales différences entre le romantisme et le réalisme dans la littérature du 19ème siècle?
<output>
<think>
C'est une question sur l'histoire littéraire, donc je n'ai pas besoin d'informations récentes. Je dois comparer deux mouvements spécifiques: le romantisme et le réalisme. Ma réponse doit couvrir ces deux éléments, donc l'exhaustivité est importante ici. La pluralité n'est pas la priorité dans ce cas.

Shakespeare の最も有名な悲劇を5つ挙げ、簡単にあらすじを説明してください。
<think>
シェイクスピアの悲劇についての質問だから、最新情報は必要ないな。「5つ挙げ」とはっきり書いてあるから、複数の回答が必要だ。どの悲劇を選ぶかは私次第で、特定の作品について比較するよう求められているわけじゃないから、完全性よりも複数性が重要だな。

What are the current interest rates for mortgage loans from Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and Chase Bank in the US?
<think>
This is asking about 'current' interest rates, so I definitely need up-to-date info. The person wants rates from three specific banks: Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and Chase. I need to cover all three to properly answer, so addressing these specific elements is more important than providing multiple different answers.

<think>
これは将来のAIトレンドについての質問だから、最新の情報が必要だね。「3つの」と明確に数を指定しているから、複数の回答が求められている。特定のトレンドについて詳しく説明するというより、重要なトレンドを3つ挙げることが大事そうだから、複数性の方が完全性より重要だな。

Was sind die besten Strategien für nachhaltiges Investieren in der heutigen Wirtschaft?
<think>
Hier geht's um Investieren in der 'heutigen Wirtschaft', also brauche ich aktuelle Informationen. Die Frage ist nach 'Strategien' im Plural gestellt, daher sollte ich mehrere Beispiele nennen. Es werden keine bestimmten Aspekte genannt, die ich alle behandeln muss - ich soll einfach verschiedene gute Strategien vorschlagen. Aktualität und mehrere Antworten sind hier wichtig.

这是关于历史事件的问题，不需要最新信息。问题清楚地列出了几个需要我回答的方面：历史背景、主要参与者、战略意义和历史影响。我需要涵盖所有这些特定方面，而不是提供多个不同的答案。这里完整性比复数性更重要。
