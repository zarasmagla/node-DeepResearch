I will now analyze these sources to extract detailed information.\n\n### Law of Georgia on Internally Displaced Persons\nThe Law of Georgia on Internally Displaced Persons provides a framework for IDP registration and assistance. According to the law, the Ministry responsible for IDP affairs is tasked with registering IDPs and providing them with adequate housing.\n\n### Registration Criteria\nThe registration criteria for IDPs in Georgia typically involve:\n1. **Proof of Displacement**: IDPs must provide documentation or evidence of their displacement from the occupied territories.\n2. **Residency Status**: Verification of residency status within the internally displaced persons' category.\n\n### Housing Assistance\nThe government of Georgia, along with international organizations, provides housing assistance to IDPs. This assistance can come in various forms, including:\n1. **Direct Housing Provision**: The government provides housing directly to IDPs.\n2. **Monetary Assistance**: Non-recurrent monetary assistance to IDPs who can afford to contribute to purchasing a flat or house.\n3. **Targeted Social Assistance (TSA)**: IDP families living below the poverty line are eligible to apply for TSA.\n\n### Official Reports and Policies\nSeveral official reports and policies outline the state's approach to IDP housing:\n1. **State Policy on Providing Housing for IDPs**: Defines adequate housing and outlines the government's strategy for providing housing to IDPs.\n2. **IDP Housing Strategy and Working Plan**: Details the government's plan for addressing the housing needs of IDPs.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe registration criteria for IDPs in Georgia involve proof of displacement and verification of residency status. Housing assistance includes direct housing provision, monetary assistance, and targeted social assistance. Official reports and policies, such as the Law of Georgia on Internally Displaced Persons and the State Policy on Providing Housing for IDPs, guide the government's approach to supporting IDPs.\n\nI hope this information is helpful.
